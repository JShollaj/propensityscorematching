    "However certain issues arise when banks are involved in trading.  A myriad of investment activities undertaken by the bank have been a significant source of risk for the banks leading to catastrophic unintended consequences, such as the financial crisis in 2008. Therefore, regulators concluded that something needs to be done to mitigate the risk associated with such ventures in the future. \n",

    "The Volcker's rule was supposed to be the antidote to the problem in hand. In it's core, Volcker's rule prohibits banks from conducting certain investment activities with their own accounts, and limits their ownership of and relationship with hedge funds and private equity funds. In more detail,  to limit the risk-taking of the companies' investment activities by Volcker's rule would reduce the size of the trading book (the size of the holdings of financial assets) relative to\n",

    "Based on the abovementioned series of testing we were able to derive that banks responded to the regulation by significantly dropping their trading assets as compared to the period before the Volcker's Rule enactment. The banks which responded the most to the regulation are also the banks which were significantly more exposed to the activities now banned or limited by the Volcker Rule (which in our case are institutions with largest trading books allocation). Conversely, the bank holding companies which responded least are the banks which had zero trading asset ratios when the Volcker Rule was introduced, and therefore their response is also the weakest (since their model was not based on or relying on trading and investing their own funds to significant risks)\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for this is due to the nature of Volcker's Rule. The rule enactment discouraged banks from taking too much risk by barring them from using their own funds to make these types of investments to increase profits. Since the many of the banks relied more on investing their own funds to a higher extend of their overall trading assets, they were also more exposed and more affected by the rule. "
